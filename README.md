# leetcode-practice-python
This repository is a template which automates the boilerplate code when adding solutions to leetcode problems.

Using a single command, one can get the question information, generate the python executable template, generate the test files, and update the table at the end of the README.

This repository uses [leetcode-cli](https://github.com/skygragon/leetcode-cli) to get the question information. Big thanks to the leetcode-cli owners for providing such tool.

## Usage
